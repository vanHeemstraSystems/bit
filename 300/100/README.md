# 100 - Create Components

A component is a reusable, independently source-controlled module, that is stored in [scopes](https://bit.dev/docs/scope/scope-overview) and maintained in [workspaces](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/start-bit-workspace). Components enable a new software development strategy that can be used to complement monorepos and poly-repos, or replace them, altogether.

Components can be of various types. Choose between a client-side component (React is used here as an example) and a server-side component.
